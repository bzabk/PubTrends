",200116672,In vivo molecular signatures of severe dengue infection revealed by viscRNA-Seq,"Dengue virus infection can result in severe symptoms including shock and hemorrhage, but an understanding of the molecular correlates of disease severity is lacking. Bulk transcriptomics on blood samples are difficult to interpret because the blood is composed of different cell types that may react differently to virus infection. Dengue virus RNA can be detected in human plasma, however identifying the cells carrying dengue virus through the bloodstream in vivo has proven challenging. Here we used our recently developed viscRNA-Seq approach to profile transcriptomes of thousands of single blood peripheral mononuclear cells from 6 human subjects with dengue fever and severe dengue, as well as to characterize the cell types associated with dengue virus in the human blood. We found that although no bulk transcriptome marker for severe dengue exists, the expression of MX2 in naive B cells, of CD163 in CD14+/CD16+ monocytes and of other genes in specific cell types is highly predictive for severe dengue. We detected virus-associated cells in the blood of two severe dengue patients with high viral load and discovered the majority of these to be B cells expressing germline IgM or IgD immunoglobulin chains and naive markers but also showing signs of activation and expression of CD69, CXCR4, and other surface receptors. In bystander B cells we detected signs of strong immune activation, parallel hypersomatic evolution and, in one severe degue subject, an anomalously large clone of highly mutated, IgG1 plasmablasts that could be reactive to dengue virus. This study presents a high-resolution molecular exploration into dengue virus infection in humans and can be generalized to any RNA virus.",Blood cells from dengue virus infected human patients were subjected to virus-inclusive single cell RNA-Seq.,Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Homo sapiens

",200216999,Xenografted human microglia display diverse transcriptomic states in response to Alzheimer’s disease-related Aβ pathology,"Microglia are central players in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) pathology, but analyzing microglia states in human brain samples is challenging due to genetic diversity, postmortem delay and admixture of pathologies. To circumvent these issues, here we generated 138,577 single cell expression profiles of human stem cell-derived microglia xenotransplanted in the brain of the AppNL-G-F model of amyloid pathology and wild type controls. Xenografted human microglia adopt a disease-associated (DAM) profile similar to that seen in mouse microglia, but display a more pronounced HLA state, likely related to antigen presentation in response to amyloid plaques. The human microglial response also involves a pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine CRM response to oligomeric Aβo. Genetic deletion of TREM2 or APOE, as well as APOE polymorphisms and TREM2R47H expression in the transplanted microglia modulate these responses differentially. The expression of other AD risk genes is differentially regulated across the distinct cell states elicited in response to amyloid pathology. Thus, we have identified multiple transcriptomic cell states adopted by human microglia in response to AD-related pathology, which should be taken into account in translational studies.","The main goal of this project is to decipher the complex human microglial response towards amyloid aggregates. Here, we transplanted human microglia progenitors from several stem cell lines (UKBIO11-A, BIONi010-C and H9) into the mouse brain of AppNL-G-F, Apphu/hu or AppNL-G-F ApoE-/-  mice to mimic several amyloid pathology conditions, including injection of oligomeric Aβo.

Here, we successfully engraft human microglia derived from embryonic stem cells in the mouse brain. The cells recapitulate transcriptionally human primary microglia ex vivo and show expression of human specific AD-risk genes. Oligomeric Amyloid-β induces a divergent response in human vs. mouse microglia. This model can be used to study the role of microglia in neurological diseases.","To control for variability across different experiments, tissue from three mice was pooled in all experimental conditions, from different litters and transplanted with H9-microglia produced in independent batches of in vitro differentiation. Across the manuscript we report both the number of mice/differentiations pooled, as well as the number of sequencing pools. In summary, 1) we sequenced 2,246 transplanted H9-microglia (n=3/1, 3 mice in 1 combined sequencing pool), 4496 H9-derived monocytes (n=2/1, 2 differentiations in 1 combined sequencing pool) and 3385 microglia in vitro (n=2/1), and 22,846 human primary microglia obtained from cortical surgical resections. 2) We sequenced 4880 transplanted H9-microglia (n=3x2/2) and 9942 host mouse cells (n=3x2/2) and assessed their differential response to oligomeric amyloid beta.",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Mus musculus; Homo sapiens

",200118723,Discovery and characterization of variance QTLs in human induced pluripotent stem cells,"Quantification of gene expression levels at the single cell level has revealed that gene expression can vary substantially even across a population of homogeneous cells. However, it is currently unclear what genomic features control variation in gene expression levels, and whether common genetic variants may impact gene expression variation. Here, we take a genome-wide approach to identify expression variance quantitative trait loci (vQTLs). To this end, we generated single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from 53 Yoruba individuals. We collected data for a median of 95 cells per individual and a total of 5,447 single cells, and identified 241 mean expression QTLs (eQTLs) at 10% FDR, of which 82% replicate in bulk RNA-seq data from the same individuals. We further identified 14 vQTLs at 10% FDR, but demonstrate that these can also be explained as effects on mean expression. Our study suggests that dispersion QTLs (dQTLs), which could alter the variance of expression independently of the mean, have systematically smaller effect sizes than eQTLs. We estimate that at least 300 cells per individual and 400 individuals would be required to have modest power to detect the strongest dQTLs in iPSCs. These results will guide the design of future studies on understanding the genetic control of gene expression variance.","The goal of our study was to identify quantitative trait loci associated with gene expression variance across cells (vQTLs). Using the Fluidigm C1 platform, we isolated and collected scRNA-seq from 7,585 single cells from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines of 54 Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI) individuals. We used unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to tag RNA molecules and account for amplification bias in the single cell data (Islam et al., 2014). To estimate technical confounding effects without requiring separate technical replicates, we used a mixed-individual plate study design. The key idea of this approach is that having observations from the same individual under different confounding effects and observations from different individuals under the same confounding effect allows us to distinguish the two sources of variation (Tung et al., 2017).",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Other,Homo sapiens

In this study, we used single-cell RNA-seq to identify 11 transcriptionally diverse CD8+ T cell subsets in psoriatic and healthy skin. Among several inflammatory subsets enriched in psoriatic skin, we observed two Tc17 subsets that were metabolically divergent, developmentally related, and expressed CXCL13, which we found to be a biomarker of psoriasis severity. Despite high co-inhibitory receptor expression in the Tc17 clusters, a comparison of these cells with melanoma-infiltrating CD8+ T cells revealed upregulated cytokine, cytolytic, and metabolic transcriptional activity in the psoriatic cells that differed from an exhaustion program.

",200023694,Analysis and design of RNA sequencing experiments for identifying mRNA isoform regulation,"Through alternative splicing, most human genes express multiple isoforms that may have distinct or even antagonistic functions. To infer isoform regulation based on data from high-throughput sequencing of cDNA fragments (RNA-Seq), we have developed MISO, a computational model that estimates the expression level of alternatively spliced exons and mRNA isoforms and provides intuitive measures of conﬁdence in these estimates. Incorporation of the length distribution of inserted cDNA fragments in paired-end RNA-Seq analysis in MISO enables dramatic improvements in estimation of alternative splicing levels relative to previous methods. We show that one lane of paired-end RNA-Seq data can provide far more information about splicing than two lanes of single-end data, depending critically on properties of the distribution of cDNA fragment lengths in the sequenced library. MISO also leads to an intuitive method to detect diﬀerentially regulated exons  or isoforms. Application of this method implicates the RNA splicing factor hnRNP H in regulation of alternative cleavage and polyadenylation, a role that is supported by UV  crosslinking/immunoprecipitation/high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-Seq) analysis. Together, our results provide a probabilistic framework for RNA-Seq analysis, derive functional insights into pre-mRNA processing, and yield guidelines for the optimal design of RNA-Seq experiments for studies of gene and isoform expression.","CLIPseq of hnRNP H in HEK 293T cells.

Here, we employ single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to characterize developing Arabidopsis thaliana seeds, with a focus on endosperm. Endosperm, the site of gene imprinting in plants, mediates the relationship between the maternal parent and embryo. We identify new cell types in the chalazal endosperm region, which interfaces with maternal tissue for nutrient unloading. We further demonstrate that the extent of parental bias of maternally expressed imprinted genes varies with cell cycle phase, and that imprinting of paternally expressed imprinted genes is strongest in chalazal endosperm. These data indicate imprinting in endosperm is heterogeneous and suggest that parental conflict, which is proposed to drive the evolution of imprinting, is fiercest at the boundary between filial and maternal tissues.","To identify cell/nuclei types and investigate imprinting dynamics within endosperm, single nucleus RNA-seq was performed using the Smart-seq2 method on seed nuclei, targeting either the 3C or 6C FANS peak in order to enrich for triploid endosperm (other seed tissues are diploid). A total of 1,664 libraries were sequenced, of which 64 were negative controls (no DNA in library prep or no cell sorted), 51 were made from two nuclei to test single-nuclei sorting accuracy, 112 failed QC checks (< 1,500 genes detected and/or <1,000 detected with 5+ reads), and the remaining 1,437 were high-quality single-nuclei libraries used in final analysis.

Please note that the counts.txt files for the P17_10A, P21_10A, and P22_10A samples are identical as they are from negative controls that should not have any reads mapping to A. thaliana.
There are  ~50 negative controls in the dataset, and most have at least one or two reads falling in a gene somewhere and so the processed data files (read counts per gene) aren't exactly the same, but the read counts in all three files are actually zero for all genes, so all three files are identical.",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Arabidopsis thaliana

Enigmatically, plants induce similar transcriptome responses upon infection by virulent or avirulent pathogens. This renders the importance of transcriptional reprogramming for immunity obscure. Here, using RNA-seq, we generate time-series transcriptome data coupled with genetic perturbations to reveal temporal dynamics upon infection by virulent or avirulent strains of a bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae, in Arabidopsis thaliana. Fast and sustained transcriptional reprogramming occurs upon infection with avirulent strains while virulent strain infection leads to a slower response with comparable gene expression patterns and magnitudes. Importantly, transcriptome analysis of resistant and susceptible mutants responding to avirulent strains links delayed transcriptional reprogramming to compromised immunity. Taken together, our results pinpoint the early critical time window of transcriptional reprogramming for establishing effective immunity against the bacterial pathogen.","Leaves of Col-0 and all the single, double, triple and quadruple mutants of dde2-2, ein2-1, pad4-1, sid2-2 were syringe-infiltrated with mock (water) or suspensions of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pto DC3000) carrying an empty vector (pLAFR), Pto DC3000 carrying AvrRpt2, or Pto DC3000 carrying AvrRpm1 at the OD600 of 0.001.

",200065685,Population epigenomics of Swedish Arabidopsis,"Plants display remarkable developmental and phenotypic plasticity in order to adapt to their environment. It has long been postulated that epigenetics plays a key role in these processes, but with one or two exceptions, solid evidence for the role of epigenetic variation in these processes is lacking. A key impediment to understanding these processes is the lack of information on the extent of epigenetic variation and how it relates to genetic and phenotypic variation in natural population, both over the lifecycle of an individual, and over evolutionary time. Here we show that genetic variants under selection in the north of Sweden appear to drive variation in DNA methylation, which in turn is highly correlated with local climate. Selective sweeps and genetic variants associated with adaptation to the local environment have previously been identified within the Swedish Arabidopsis population. Our finding that they harbour variants responsible for climate associated epigenetic variation strongly supports the role of epigenetic processes in local adaptation.

A possible regulatory role for suberin in root growth angle control was also identified.","Seedlings of S. lycopersicum (cv. M82), S. pennellii (LA0716), and 75 introgression lines between those parents were grown according to (Ron et al., 2013). Plates were placed vertically in a rack in a randomized block design and the experiments were carried out in a growth chamber with a 16:8 light:dark cycle at 22ºC and 50-75% humidity with a light intensity of 100μE. The germination date was monitored for each seed. Immediately prior to harvesting root tissue for RNA-seq, each replicate of each genotype had between 2 and 5 plates, all of which were scanned with a Epson Perfection V700 photo flatbed scanner into 24-bit RGB TIF image files at 300 dpi. Images were analyzed with the imageJ program (Rasband 1997-2014) and custom macros. Based on germination date and scan date, seedling age in days after germination was determined, and primary roots of seedlings that were 3 or 4 days post-germination were traced with the imageJ polyline tool, following the root centerline from the top of the root (at start of hairs and change from green to white) to the tip. The coordinates of the polylines were recorded by the macros in data tables saved as files, along with metadata including genotype, plate ID, plating date, germination day of each seedling, plate harvest date, measurer, and two flags for each root: “collide” was true if the root contacted or crossed another root, and “along” was true if the root contacted another root and grew along it for any distance. The polylines in the vetted data were analyzed to measure root length and angle using multiple traits (Figure 1A). Additional data was calculated from the metadata: root age (days from germination to harvest), “germination age” (days from plating to germination), “plating age” (days from plating to harvest), and biological replicate number (based on plating date; replicates were named REP2 through REP5, and later replicates for fixing genotype errors were named REPN2 through REPN5 and REPX1 through REPX6). Plates were opened only once, at harvest time, to ensure the same growth conditions for all seedlings. Sampling occurred mid-afternoon. Ten segments (1cm) of the root tip from each genotype replicate were cut and immediately placed into a labeled 2ml tube containing silica beads and immersed in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at −80ºC until library preparation. Four replicates of each of the 77 genotypes were grown. Between 7 and 14 root tips, 3 to 4 days post-germination, were collected and libraries were created using a modified Kumar et. al. protocol. Library enrichment was done using 12 cycles.

These proteins also silenced many other genes with different efficacy, and a machine learning model could accurately predict the efficacy of each silencer based on various chromatin features of the target loci. Furthermore, some proteins were also able to target gene silencing when used in a dCas9-SunTag system.

We identified the paternally methylated DMRs at mouse chromosome 1 near the imprinted Zdbf2 gene using a methylated-DNA immunoprecipitation-on-chip (meDIP-on-chip) method applied to DNA from parthenogenetic (PG)- and androgenetic (AG)-derived cells and sperm. ,"To identify novel DMRs, genome-wide methylation analysis of three samples were performed using MeDIP and whole genome tiling array.",Methylation profiling by genome tiling array,Mus musculus

The CTD in mammals is composed of 52 heptad-repeats with the consensus sequence Y1-S2-P3-T4-S5-P6-S7. Repeats in the distal part of CTD deviate from the consensus sequence and have frequently replaced serine at position 7 by lysine residues (K7). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed modification of K7 residues in heptad-repeats 39, 42, and 47/49 by acetylation and in heptad-repeats 38, 39, 40, 42, and 47/49 by mono-, di-, or trimethylation. Notably, acetylated as well as di- and tri-methylated K7 residues were found exclusively in phosphorylated CTD peptides, while mono-methylated K7 residues occurred also in non-phosphorylated CTD peptides. Methylation of K7 residues was further studied with the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1F5, which recognizes mono- and di-methylated K7 in CTD. ChIP experiments revealed high levels of K7 methylation at the transcriptional start site of genes. The low levels of K7 methylation in the body of genes results from impairment of epitope recognition in hyper-phosphorylated CTD by mAb 1F5. In agreement with this notion, phosphatase treatment of hyper-phosphorylated CTD or treatment of cells with kinase inhibitor flavopiridol restored the reactivity of mAb 1F5 towards methylated K7 residues in CTD. We conclude that methylation and acetylation of K7 residues further expand the mammalian CTD code and potentially contribute to regulation of gene expression.",This study was performed in a human Raji cell line.

We describe a set of integrated experiments designed to investigate the effects of common genetic variability on DNA methylation, mRNA expression and microRNA (miRNA) expression in four distinct human brain regions. We show that brain tissues may be readily distinguished based on methylation status or expression profile. We find an abundance of genetic cis regulation mRNA expression and show for the first time abundant quantitative trait loci for DNA CpG methylation. We observe that the largest magnitude effects occur across distinct brain regions. We believe these data, which we have made publicly available, will be useful in understanding the biological effects of genetic variation.

Most of the studies characterizing DNA methylation patterns have been restricted to particular genomic loci in a limited number of human samples and pathological conditions. The recently arrived single-base-resolution technologies for DNA methylation are extremely helpful tools, but are not yet applicable and affordable for studying large groups of subjects. Herein, we present a compromise between an extremely comprehensive study of a human sample population with an intermediate level of resolution of CpGs at the genomic level. We obtained a DNA methylation fingerprint of 1,628 human samples where we interrogated 1,505 CpG sites. The DNA methylation patterns revealed show this epigenetic mark to be critical in tissue-type definition and stemness, particularly around transcription start sites that are not within a CpG island. For disease, the generated DNA methylation fingerprints show that, during tumorigenesis, human cancer cells underwent a progressive gain of promoter CpG island hypermethylation and a loss of CpG methylation in non-CpG island promoters. Although transformed cells are those where DNA methylation disruption is more obvious, we observed that other common human diseases, such as neurological and autoimmune disorders, had their own distinct DNA methylation profiles. Most importantly, we provide proof of principle that the obtained DNA methylation fingerprints might be useful for translational purposes by showing that are able to identify the tumor type origin of Cancers of Unknown Primary (CUPs). Thus, the DNA methylation patterns identified across the largest spectrum of samples, tissues and diseases reported to date constitute a baseline for developing higher-resolution DNA methylation maps, and provide important clues concerning the contribution of CpG methylation to tissue identity and its changes in the most prevalent human diseases.","It was studied the genomic DNA from 1,628 human samples corresponding to 424 normal tissues (180 leukocytes, 97 colon mucosa and 227 other normal samples), 1,054 tumorigenic samples (premalignant lesions, primary tumors and metastases) and 150 non-cancerous disorders, such as brain lesions from Alzheimer’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, aortic atherosclerotic lesions, myopathies and autoimmune disorders.",Methylation profiling by array,Homo sapiens

Surprisingly, DNA replication was also required for 5hmC generation, especially in the female pronucleus.

However, the pathogenic variants in these loci have not yet been found. We conducted a genome-wide scan for large copy number variations (CNVs) in a dataset of Caribbean Hispanic origin (554 controls and 559 cases with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease) that was previously investigated in a SNP-based genome-wide association study using Illumina HumanHap 650Y platform. We ran four CNV calling algorithms and analyzed rare large CNVs (>100 Kb) to obtain high-confidence calls that were detected by at least two algorithms. In total, 734 such CNVs were observed in our dataset. Global burden analyses did not reveal significant differences between cases and controls in CNV rate, distribution of deletions or duplications, total or average CNV size; and number of genes affected by CNVs. However, we observed a nominal association between Alzheimer’s disease and a ~470 Kb duplication on chromosome15q11.2 (P=0.037). This duplication, encompassing up to five genes (TUBGCP5, CYFIP1, NIPA2, NIPA1 and WHAMML1) was present in 10 cases (2.6%) and 3 controls (0.8%). The dosage increase of CYFIP1 and NIPA1 genes was further confirmed by quantitative PCR. The current study did not detect CNVs (including common CNVs) that affect novel Alzheimer’s disease loci reported by large genome-wide association studies. However, since the array technology used in our study has limitations in detecting small CNVs, future studies must carefully assess novel AD associated genes for the presence of disease related CNVs.","Case-control analysis, screening of large copy number variation in 559 Alzheimer cases and 554 control subjects of Caribbean Hispanic ancestry",Genome variation profiling by SNP array,Homo sapiens

The top candidate biomarkers were tested in an independent cohort for ability to predict state short-term memory, and trait future positive neuropsychological testing for cognitive impairment","Alzheimer disease (AD) is a clear and present danger to older adults, and has a profound socio-economic impact (refs). Existing therapies are limited in efficacy (refs). Early identification of individuals at risk may open the door to preventive approaches.  Short-term memory dysfunction is a key early feature of AD. We proposed to identify blood biomarkers that track a relevant related quantitative phenotype for short-term memory, the retention measure of recall in Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) (Figure S1).  Previous work by our group has identified blood gene expression biomarkers that track suicidal ideation using longitudinal within-subject designs, validated them in suicide completers, and tested them in independent cohorts for ability to assess state (suicidal ideation), and ability to predict trait (future hospitalizations for suicidality) (Le-Niculescu et al. Molecular Psychiatry 2013, Niculescu et al. Molecular Psychiatry 2015) (Levey et al. Molecular Psychiatry 2016) (Niculescu et al. Molecular Psychiatry 2017). Those biomarkers were also useful in pharmacogenomic and drug repurposing analyses. We endeavored to use a similar approach to identify biomarkers for short-term memory.  We conducted our longitudinal studies in psychiatric disorder subjects, a population enriched in memory retention abnormalities, and which  may be at increased risk of AD and other aging-related disorders, due to the effects  of stress and depression (Nho et al. 2015, Rangaraju et al. 2016, al refs).  The subjects had blood gene expression data at multiple testing visits, and were phenotyped at each visit, including with HVLT. They also had electronic medical records for long term follow-up of subsequent outcomes, including future neuropsychological testing as part of standard clinical care.

",200159596,Non-coding RNAs shape cortical neurons developmental trajectories,"A hallmark of cortical evolution is the high dynamic subventricular zone (SVZ) expansion, where basal progenitors (BPs) amplify and neuronal transcriptional programs unfold. How non-coding molecular factors such as microRNAs influence these developmental trajectories and regulate the acquisition of cortical type identities is largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that miR-137 and miR-122 regulate the positioning and identity features of superficial layer cortical neurons by acting at distinct steps of their developmental trajectories. MiR-137 sustains basal progenitor amplification by reverting their neurogenic commitment and inducing high proliferative state upregulating Cd63 and inhibiting Myt1l. Cd63 is an extra-cellular matrix (ECM) receptor which interacts with b3- and 1-integrin pathways to promote proliferation, while Myt1l is a transcription factor that promotes and sustains neuronal fate. The BPs amplification by miR-137 is converted in the promotion of intracortical projecting neuron (ICPN) identity and L2/3 expansion. As opposed to miR-137, miR-122 acts postmitotically, affecting the bioelectrical properties, the calcium and cytoskeleton dynamics of newborn neurons as well as their transcriptional program, leading to a persistent molecular immaturity across time. Overall, these findings reveal that miR-137 and miR-122 are key regulators of the developmental trajectory of cortical neurons across evolution.","Investigation of the non-coding RNAs miR-122 and miR-137 overexpression on progenitor and neuron transcriptional programs.   psil-miR122, psil-miR137 or psil-scramble (control) plasmids were in utero electroporated together with pUB-GFP or pUB-Tomato plasmid in mouse embryos at embryonic day (E) 14.5, and cells collected at E15.5, E17.5 or postnatal day (P) 7 using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).

Here we identify a brief period in ferret embryonic development when apical RGCs generate a burst of bRGCs that become founders of the OSVZ.  After this period, bRGCs in the OSVZ proliferate and self-renew exclusively locally, thereby forming a self-sustained lineage independent from the other germinal layers.  The time window for the brief period of OSVZ bRGC production is delineated by the coincident down-regulation of Cdh1 and Trnp1, and their up-regulation reduces bRGC production and prevents OSVZ seeding.  This mechanism in cortical development may have key relevance in brain evolution and disease",Samples were analyzed with 3 replicates of each of them (except E34SVZ that has 2 replicantes).

We find unique transcriptional signatures in each germinal compartment, indicating that thousands of genes are differentially expressed between regions, including ~80% of genes mutated in human cortical malformations. Regional differences result from sharp changes in gene expression levels, which occur at multiple locations across the developing cortex of ferret and human, but not in the lissencephalic mouse. These complex expression patterns emerge sequentially during development and map the eventual location of specific folds and fissures. Our findings demonstrate that step-wise gene expression maps within germinal layers distinguish the development of gyrencephaly from lissencephaly, and may contribute to identify novel genes responsible for human malformations.",Six samples were analyzed with 3 replicates of each of them.

",200115513,miRNA and colorectal cancer:  associations with tumor phenotype and survival,"MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of small regulatory RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional silencing of specific target mRNAs.  Data suggest the importance of miRNAs to cancer development and possibly to survival.  Our overall hypothesis is that miRNA expression is unique to tumor molecular phenotype; that miRNA expression levels at time of diagnosis predicts survival; and that miRNA expression is associated with inflammation-related genetic and lifestyle factors key to colorectal cancer (CRC). This study takes a two pronged approach to addressing our hypotheses.  While we propose to validate previously identified miRNAs that have been identified as associated with CRC (either by differential expression or from assessment of mutations), we will add to the field through discovery of new and important associations that may be unique to specific molecular phenotypes, to polyp to cancer progression, and  to survival.  We have analyzed the expression of 2006 human miRNAs using data derived from tumor and paired normal tissue at time of diagnosis from:  1975 people with incident colon cancer or rectal cancer and 290 polyps from colon and rectal cases (included in this study) who reported a prior polyp.  MiRNA was obtained from dissected paraffin-embedded tissue and assessed using an Agilent microarray platform.  We intend to extend our validation of previously identified mutated miRNAs and differentially expressed miRNAs to determine if these alterations are associated with specific tumor molecular phenotype (TP53, KRAS2, CIMP+, and for colon tumors MSI+), inflammation-related factors, clinical factors and survival.  We will identify associations with miRNAs that are related to specific molecular phenotypes, with drivers in the carcinogenic process, and with clinical features and survival.  These miRNAs will be validated using targeted Agilent Platform. Associations will be tested based on differential expression for both individual and groups of miRNAs using recent extensions of several statistical methods including ANOVA, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazards models.  Our sample size allows for both a training and validation component, and provides sufficient statistical power to meet the study goals.  MiRNAs that are differentially expressed in polyps and in subsequent tumors will provide new insights into targets for screening and treatment as well as provide support that miRNAs function as the “driver” in the carcinogenic process.  Testing of mutated miRNAs identified from sequencing in conjunction with tumor phenotype, clinical, and survival data will further validate the importance of these miRNAs, and provide insight as to which CRC molecular pathway the miRNAs function.  Our rich dataset of lifestyle, genetic, clinical and prognosis, and tumor molecular phenotype on 1975 CRC and paired normal tissue allows us to examine factors that are associated with miRNA expression and mutation in a large sample of population-based cases in the most cost-efficient manner possible. The miRNAs identified in these analyses will elucidate pathways important in the etiology of CRC and will provide insight into potential targets for screening and treatment. MiRNAs are small, non-protein-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression either by post-transcriptionally suppressing mRNA translation or by mRNA degradation.  We examine differentially expressed miRNAs in colorectal carcinomas, adenomas, and normal colonic mucosa. Data come from population-based studies of colorectal cancer conducted in Utah and the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program.  A total of 1893 carcinoma/normal paired samples and 290 adenoma tissue samples were run on the Agilent Human miRNA Microarray V19.0 which contained 2006 miRNAs.  We tested for significant differences in miRNA expression between paired carcinoma/adenoma/normal colonic tissue samples.  Fewer than 600 miRNAs were expressed in >80% of people for colonic tissue; of these 86.5% were statistically differentially expressed between carcinoma and normal colonic mucosa using a False Discovery Rate of 0.05.  Roughly half of these differentially expressed miRNAs showed a progression in levels of expression from normal to adenoma to carcinoma tissue.  Other miRNAs appeared to be altered at the normal to adenoma stage, while others were only altered at the adenoma to carcinoma stage or only at the normal to carcinoma stage.    Evaluation of the Agilent platform showed a high degree of repeatability (r=0.98) and reasonable agreement with the NanoString platform.  Our data suggest that miRNAs are highly dysregulated in colorectal tissue among individuals with colorectal cancer; the pattern of disruption varies by miRNA as tissue progresses from normal to adenoma to carcinoma.","Population-based ascertainment of all diagnosed cases of colorectal cancer from Utah and Northern California Kaiser.

Coordinately, cardiac glycoside treatment downregulated total and phosphorylated Tau in rodent and human neurons and protected against toxicity by glutamate, N-methyl-D-aspartate, rotenone, and Aβ oligomers.

Signals from the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment dynamically tailor hematopoiesis, but the effect of aging on the niche and the contribution of the aging niche to blood aging still remains unclear. Here, we show the development of an inflammatory milieu in the aged marrow cavity, which drives both niche and hematopoietic system remodeling. We find decreased numbers and functionality of osteogenic endosteal mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), expansion of pro-inflammatory perisinusoidal MSCs, and deterioration of the central marrow sinusoidal endothelium, which together create a self-reinforcing inflamed BM milieu. Single cell molecular mapping of old niche cells further confirms disruption of cell identities and enrichment of inflammatory response genes. Inflammation, in turn, drives chronic activation of emergency myelopoiesis pathways in old HSCs and multipotent progenitors, which promotes myeloid differentiation at the expense of lymphoid and erythroid commitment, and hinders hematopoietic regeneration. Remarkably, both defective hematopoietic regeneration, niche deterioration and HSC aging can be improved by blocking inflammatory IL-1 signaling.

Vaccination against many different infectious agents is also sub-optimal in these individuals. To investigate the mechanisms involved in the decline in immunity during ageing we inject safe derivatives of microorganisms into the skin of old and young volunteers.  After injection of the agent, we can extract the white cells (leucocytes) that accumulate at the site of the immune response to test for their function.  One of the responses we have been investigating is that to the varicella zoster virus (VZV) that induces chickenpox mainly in young individuals. Infected subjects control this persistent virus until an older age where reduced immunity leads to viral re-activation to cause shingles.  We have found that this defective response is associated with increased baseline inflammation in this tissue. Although inflammatory responses are required to clear infections, excessive inflammation has previously been shown to interfere with the generation of specific immunity.  We will therefore investigate ways of enhancing the immune response of older humans by blocking basal inflammation.     To extend our initial observations of high background inflammation in the skin, we will investigate which cells in this tissue are responsible for the production of inflammatory mediators by using a second human experimental system that tests the response to a skin irritant known as cantharadin. Next we will block inflammation in the skin to determine whether this can lead to improved responses upon challenge with antigens. This will be achieved by pre-treating old subjects with a drug that has already been developed by GSK (Losmapimod, p38MAPkinase inhibitor) and another that is available off the shelf (vitamin D3). The GSK p38 inhibitors are currently being tested to prevent unwanted inflammation. A surprising observation we made was that p38 inhibition could also rejuvenate human T lymphocytes and enhance their ability to proliferate in vitro. Therefore the inhibition of p38 may block unwanted inflammatory response as well as enhance T lymphocyte reactivity. Vitamin D3 has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects and works in part by inhibiting p38MAPkinase activation. The use of 2 separate interventions in this project increases the likelihood of success in this study. While Losmapimod may be more specific in its anti-inflammatory action, the use of vitamin D3 is more cost effective as it is a cheap compound that is readily available.     The desirable outcome of this study is that either one or other of these compounds, that older volunteers will be treated with, will boost their response to microbial antigen challenge in the skin. This will provide proof of concept data that will lead to the exciting possibility of enhancing immunity by inhibiting the increased baseline inflammatory responses that are found during ageing. This may be a strategy to enhance immune responses in general and specifically to enhance vaccination efficacy to various diseases that is less effective in older subjects.","A total of 126 samples were analysed, including normal skin (n=30), saline (6 hour; n=30), VZV (6 hour; n=32), and VZV (day2; n=34).",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Homo sapiens

Previous studies have shown that semen quality decreases with advanced aging with an increased presence of inflammatory cells. In this study, we examined the DNA methylation of seminal fluid to understand how the methylome changes with age and infertility. We also compare the age associated changes in semen to those observed in buccal swabs in order to characterize differences in epigenetic aging across diverse tissues. We found that infertility associated changes in the DNA methylation of semen are driven by changes in cell composition, while those associated with aging are linked to inflammatory genes. Many age associated sites are demethylated with advanced aging and are associated with the activation of inflammatory pathways. By contrast, we do not observe age associated changes in inflammatory genes in buccal swab methylomes, which instead are characterized by changes to bivalent promoters. Our study suggests that DNA methylation could serve as a biomarker for male infertility assessment in addition to the standard semen analysis.","To examine the changes in DNA methylation of seminal fluids along with age and to compare across tissues, we collected semen and buccal samples from 83 individuals.

Compared to men, women are not only nearly twice as likely to develop Alzheimer’s, but they also experience worse neuropathological burden and cognitive decline despite living longer with the disease. It remains unclear how and when sex differences in biological aging emerge and contribute to Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis. We hypothesized that these differences lead to distinct molecular Alzheimer’s disease signatures in males and females, which could be harnessed for therapeutic and biomarker development. We aged male and female, 3xTg-AD and B6129 control mice across their respective lifespans while longitudinally collecting brain samples. We conducted RNA sequencing analysis on bulk brain tissue and examined differentially expressed genes between 3xTg-AD and B6129 samples and across ages in each sex. 3xTg-AD males experienced an accelerated upregulation of immune-related gene expression in the brain relative to females, especially in genes involved in complement system activation, suggesting distinct inflammatory disease trajectories between the sexes.

Inflammation of aging (“inflammaging”) has been proposed as a driver of age-related changes in HSC function and myeloid malignancy, but mechanisms linking these phenomena remain poorly defined. Here, we identify loss of miR-146a as driving aging-associated inflammation in AML patients. miR-146a expression declined in old wild-type mice, and loss of miR-146a promoted premature HSC aging and inflammation in young miR-146a-null mice, preceding development of aging-associated myeloid malignancy. Using single-cell assays of HSC quiescence, stemness, differentiation potential, and epigenetic state to probe HSC function and population structure, we found that loss of miR-146a depleted a subpopulation of primitive, quiescent HSCs. DNA methylation and transcriptome profiling implicated NF-κB, IL6, and TNF as potential drivers of HSC dysfunction, activating an inflammatory signaling relay promoting IL6 and TNF secretion from mature miR-146a-/- myeloid and lymphoid cells. Reducing inflammation by targeting Il6 or Tnf was sufficient to restore single-cell measures of miR-146a-/- HSC function and subpopulation structure, and reduced the incidence of hematological malignancy in miR 146a-/- mice. miR-146a-/- HSCs exhibited enhanced sensitivity to IL6 stimulation, indicating that loss of miR-146a affects HSC function via both cell-extrinsic inflammatory signals and increased cell-intrinsic sensitivity to inflammation.

Inflammation of aging (“inflammaging”) has been proposed as a driver of age-related changes in HSC function and myeloid malignancy, but mechanisms linking these phenomena remain poorly defined. Here, we identify loss of miR-146a as driving aging-associated inflammation in AML patients. miR-146a expression declined in old wild-type mice, and loss of miR-146a promoted premature HSC aging and inflammation in young miR-146a-null mice, preceding development of aging-associated myeloid malignancy. Using single-cell assays of HSC quiescence, stemness, differentiation potential, and epigenetic state to probe HSC function and population structure, we found that loss of miR-146a depleted a subpopulation of primitive, quiescent HSCs. DNA methylation and transcriptome profiling implicated NF-κB, IL6, and TNF as potential drivers of HSC dysfunction, activating an inflammatory signaling relay promoting IL6 and TNF secretion from mature miR-146a-/- myeloid and lymphoid cells. Reducing inflammation by targeting Il6 or Tnf was sufficient to restore single-cell measures of miR-146a-/- HSC function and subpopulation structure, and reduced the incidence of hematological malignancy in miR 146a-/- mice. miR-146a-/- HSCs exhibited enhanced sensitivity to IL6 stimulation, indicating that loss of miR-146a affects HSC function via both cell-extrinsic inflammatory signals and increased cell-intrinsic sensitivity to inflammation. Thus, loss of miR 146a regulates cell-extrinsic and -intrinsic mechanisms linking HSC inflammaging to the development of myeloid malignancy.","2 cell types, 2 genotypes, single-cell analysis: 64 WT LSK cells (see GSE89545), 83 WT ESLAM cells (see GSE89545), & 69 miR-146a-/- ESLAM cells, 43 passing QC (this series)",Methylation profiling by high throughput sequencing,Mus musculus

",200242202,Age-related changes in human skeletal muscle transcriptome and proteome are more affected by chronic inflammation and physical inactivity than primary aging,"Evaluation of the influence of primary and secondary aging on the manifestation of molecular and cellular hallmarks of aging is a challenging and currently unresolved issue. Our study represents the first demonstration of the distinct role of primary aging and both chronic inflammation and physical inactivity – the most important drivers of secondary aging, in the regulation of transcriptomic and proteomic profiles in human skeletal muscle. To achieve this purpose, young healthy people (n=15), young (n=8) and older (n=37) patients with knee/hip osteoarthritis, a model to study the effect of long-term inactivity and chronic inflammation on the vastus lateralis muscle, were included in the study. It was revealed that widespread and substantial age-related changes in gene expression (~4,000 genes regulating mitochondrial function, proteostasis, cell membrane, secretory and immune response) were related to the long-term physical inactivity and chronic inflammation rather than primary aging. Primary aging contributed mainly to the regulation of genes (~200) encoding nuclear proteins (regulators of DNA repair, RNA processing, and transcription), mitochondrial proteins (genes encoding respiratory enzymes, mitochondrial complex assembly factors, regulators of cristae formation and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production), as well as regulators of proteostasis. It was found that proteins associated with aging were regulated mainly at the post-transcriptional level. The set of putative primary aging genes and their potential transcriptional regulators can be used as a resource for further targeted studies investigating the role of individual genes and related transcription factors in the emergence of a senescent cell phenotype.","The study involved 37 older patients with advanced‐stage, symptomatic knee/hip osteoarthritis (OP; median age 72 years and interquartile range [69–77] years, M:F = 5:32), 8 young patients with the same diagnosis (YP; 39 [37–42] years, M:F = 7:1), and 15 young healthy volunteers (YH; 35 [28–38] years, M:F = 13:2).

",200099962,The biological age linked with oxidative estress modifies breast cancer aggressiveness,"The incidence of breast cancer increases with age until menopause, and breast cancer is more aggressive in younger women. The existence of epidemiological links between breast cancer and aging indicates that both processes possibly share some common mechanisms of development. Oxidative stress is associated with both cancer susceptibility and aging. Here we observed that ERBB2-positive breast cancer, developed from genetically different ERBB2-positive transgenic mice generated by a backcross, is more aggressive in younger than in older mice, similar to what occurs in humans. In this cohort, we estimated the oxidative biological age using a mathematical model that integrated several subphenotypes directly or indirectly related to oxidative stress. This model included the serum levels of HDL-cholesterol and magnesium that were determined at a disease-free stage, and total AKT1 and glutathione concentrations in the liver at the time of necropsy. Later we defined the grade of aging due to oxidative stress as the increment of aging, which was the difference between the predicted biological age and the chronological age. This comparison permitted the identification of the biologically younger mice with less oxidative stress and older mice with more oxidative stress than would be expected according to their chronological age. Interestingly, biologically older mice developed more aggressive breast cancer than the biologically younger mice. We identified genomic regions on chromosomes 2 and 15 that were linked to the grade of oxidative aging. The levels of expression of Zbp1 located on chromosome 2, a gene related to necroptosis and inflammation, positively correlated with the grade of oxidative aging and tumour aggressiveness.

",200009990,Transcriptional profiles of rodent hippocampal CA1 tissue during aging and cognitive decline,"Recent microarray studies in the hippocampus of rodents or Alzheimer’s disease (AD) subjects have identified a substantial number of cellular pathways/processes correlated with aging and cognitive decline. However, the temporal relationships among these expression changes or with cognitive impairment have not been studied in depth.  Here, using Affymetrix microarrays, immunohistochemistry and Morris water maze cognitive testing across 5 age groups of male F344 rats (n=9-15/group, one microarray per animal), we systematically analyzed the temporal sequence and cellular localization of aging changes in expression.  These were correlated with performance scores on the hippocampus-dependent Morris Water Maze task. Significant microarray results were sorted in to Early, Intermediate, Midlife, and Late patterns of expression, and functionally categorized (Early- downregulated neural development, lipid synthesis and energy-utilization; upregulated ribosomal synthesis, growth, stress/inflammatory, lysosome and protein/lipid degradation. Intermediate- increased defense/inflammatory activation and decreased transporter activity; Midlife- downregulated energy-dependent signaling and neurite growth, upregulated astroglial activation, Ca2+-binding, cholesterol/lipid trafficking, myelinogenic processes and additional lysosome/inflammation; Late- further recruitment of genes in already-altered pathways). Immunohistochemistry revealed a primarily astrocytic localization of the processes upregulated in midlife, as well as increased density of myelin proteins. Evidence of cognitive impairment first appeared in the 12-month-old group (midlife) and was increased further in the 23-month-old group, exhibiting the highest correlations with some upregulated genes related to cholesterol transport (e.g., Apoe, Abca2), protein management and ion binding. Some upregulated genes for inflammation (Il6st) and myelinogenesis (Pmp22) also correlated with impairment. Together, the data are consistent with a novel sequential cascade model of brain aging in which metabolic alterations early in maturity are followed by inflammation and midlife activation of an astrocyte-centered cholesterol trafficking pathway that stimulates oligodendrocyte remyelination programs. Importantly, this cholesterol trafficking pathway also may compete for astroglial bioenergetic support of neurons, in turn, leading to downregulation of energy-dependent pathways needed to sustain cognitive functions. Keywords: aging time course","Fisher 344 rats aged 3 (n = 9), 6 (n = 9), 9 (n = 9), 12 (n = 9), or 25 (n = 15; but see below) months were behaviorally characterized on the Morris water maze. Briefly, animals were placed in a circular water bath chamber with a partially submerged platform. Three times per day for three days, animals were placed at randomized starting points with the goal of locating the hidden platform. Generally, animals became better at locating the platform, and by the third day of training, were reliably swimming directly to the platform despite randomized starting loci. On the fourth day, the platform was removed and the degree to which the animals focused their searches on the area that previously contained the platform was measured. On the last day of behavior, animals were given a cue trial in which the platform was raised above the water level so that the rats could see it. Measures taken from the behavior study included path length (how long did the animal swim prior to locating the platform/ platform area), latency to platform in seconds, and velocity (centimeters/ second; swim speed). Two aged animals (E2 and E12) were removed from the study for poor health, reducing the 23 month cohort (n = 13). Twelve to twenty four hours after the last behavioral session, animals were killed and their hippocampi removed. The right hippocampus went to immunohistochemistry for quantification and localization of selected protein products. The left hippocampus was dissected, the CA1 region removed and frozen in dry ice prior to microarray processing. mRNA was extracted from each animal's tissue by standard Affymetrix protocols (see Blalock et al., 2003) and hybridized to individual microarrays (RAE 230A; N = 49 arrays in total). Results were processed with the MAS5 algorithm and subjected to ‘all probe set’ scaling with a target intensity of 500. Probe sets were filtered for presence (> = 5 presence calls study wide) and gene symbol level annotation prior to statistical analysis. 1-ANOVA across age was used to identify aging-related probe sets/genes (p <= 0.05). Aging-related genes were subjected to post hoc template correlation to determine the pattern of age-related change, and further, within the 12 and 23 month old groups, Pearson's correlation with behavioral scores was used to identify genes whose expression levels correlated significantly (p <= 0.05) with behavior. Twelve and 23 month old groups were chosen for this correlation analysis as they showed the greatest variability among similarly aged animals, suggesting that these ages show important cognitive transition phases during aging-related cognitive decline.

Bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) knockout (KO) mice develop metabolic liver diseases and progress into liver cancer as they age, and Western diet (WD) intake facilitates liver carcinogenesis in those mice. This study aimed to uncover molecular signatures within the gut-liver axis for diet and age-linked liver diseases in FXR-dependent or independent manners. Many more transcripts were changed due to WD intake and aging in WT mice than those in FXR KO mice. In other words, WD intake and aging impact the hepatic transcriptomes and metabolomes in an FXR-dependent manner. In WT mice, WD/aging upregulated inflammation-related genes and downregulated genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Urine metabolomes provided clear distinguishing for differential dietary intake. By contrast, the metabolomes of the liver, serum, or urine could reflect age differences. Further, irrespective of differential diets intake or ages, transcriptomes, metabolomes, and cecal microbiota distinguished WT and FXR KO. Western dietary patterns and aging share molecular commonality with FXR deactivation. Notably, WD, aging, and FXR deactivation commonly altered hepatic cell division-related transcripts (Cenpe, Ect2, Top2a, Kif20a, Tpx2, Nuf2, Kif18b, Aspm, E2f8, and Hmmr), which are associated with overall survival rate in HCC patients.

Possible effects of a retrotransposon insertion in the Y and Yh alleles on the transcription and expression of CpMDAR4 alleles in papaya flowers were also examined. When comparing promoters and cis-regulatory elements among genes in the non-recombining region of the sex chromosomes, paired genes exhibited differences. Our results showed that differences in the promoter sequences of the CpMDAR4 alleles drove the expression of a reporter gene to different flower tissues in Arabidopsis. β-glucuronidase staining analysis of T2 and T3 lines for constructs containing 5’ deletions of native Y and Yh allele promoters showed the loss of specific expression of the reporter gene in the anthers, confirming the existence and location of cis-regulatory element POLLEN1LELAT52. The expression analysis of CpMDAR4 alleles in papaya flowers also showed that all alleles are actively expressed in different flower tissues, with the existence of a shorter truncated isoform, with unknown function, for the Y and Yh alleles due to an LTR-RT insertion in the Y and Yh chromosomes. The observed expression patterns in Arabidopsis thaliana flowers and the expression patterns of CpMDAR4 alleles in papaya flowers, suggest that MDAR4 might have a role on development of reproductive organs in papaya, and that it constitutes an important candidate for sex differentiation.","To evaluate tissue-specific expression of CpMDAR4 alleles in papaya flowers, total RNA was extracted from small flower buds (< 1 mm), reproductive organs of pre-meiotic (1-6 mm) and post-meiotic (7-12 mm) flower buds (including aborted pistils or “pistillode”), mature flowers (15-20 mm) and gametophytes of mature ‘AU9’ female flowers and ‘AU9’ male flowers.",Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing,Carica papaya

Implications for Natural and Farmed Populations,"Background: Food supply is a major factor influencing growth rates in animals. This has important implications for both natural and farmed fish populations, since food restriction may difficult reproduction. However, a study on the effects of food supply on the development of juvenile gonads has never been transcriptionally described in fish. Methods and Findings: This study investigated the consequences of growth on gonadal transcriptome of European sea bass in: 1) 4-month-old sexually undifferentiated fish, comparing the gonads of fish with the highest vs. the lowest growth, to explore a possible link between transcriptome and future sex, and 2) testis from 11-month-old juveniles where growth had been manipulated through changes in food supply. The four groups used were: i) sustained fast growth, ii) sustained slow growth, iii) accelerated growth, iv) decelerated growth. The transcriptome of undifferentiated gonads was not drastically affected by initial natural differences in growth. Further, changes in the expression of genes associated with protein turnover were seen, favoring catabolism in slow-growing fish and anabolism in fast-growing fish. Moreover, while fast-growing fish took energy from glucose, as deduced from the pathways affected and the analysis of protein-protein interactions examined, in slow-growing fish lipid metabolism and gluconeogenesis was favored. Interestingly, the highest transcriptomic differences were found when forcing initially fast-growing fish to decelerate their growth, while accelerating growth of initially slow-growing fish resulted in full transcriptomic convergence with sustained fast-growing fish. Conclusions: Food availability during sex differentiation shapes the juvenile testis transcriptome, as evidenced by adaptations to different energy balances. Remarkably, this occurs in absence of major histological changes in the testis. Thus, fish are able to recover transcriptionally their testes if they are provided with enough food supply during sex differentiation; however, an initial fast growth does not represent any advantage in terms of transcriptional fitness if later food becomes scarce.",Whole gonad transcriptome analysis from 35 individuals.

",200197916,Metabolic competition between lipid metabolism and histone methylation regulates sexual differentiation in human malaria parasites,"Like most pathogens, malaria parasites balance persistence in the current host with transmission to the next. For Plasmodium falciparum, the most widespread and virulent human malaria parasite, persistence depends on continuous asexual replication in red blood cells while transmission requires differentiation into non-replicating gametocytes, the male and female cells able to infect the mosquito vector. This developmental decision is controlled via stochastic derepression of a heterochromatin-silenced locus encoding the transcription factor PfAP2-G, which acts as the master switch for sexual differentiation. Recent work showed that the frequency of pfap2-g derepression is responsive to extracellular levels of phospholipid precursors. However, the regulatory mechanisms linking these metabolites to epigenetic regulation of pfap2-g was hitherto unknown. Using chemical, metabolomic, and genetic approaches, we show that this response is mediated by metabolic competition for the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine between histone methyltransferases and phospho-ethanolamine methyltransferase, a critical enzyme in the parasite’s pathway for de novo phosphatidyl-choline synthesis. When phosphatidyl-choline precursors are scarce, increased consumption of S-adenosylmethionine for de novo synthesis of phosphatidyl-choline results in a decrease in histone methylation marks that mediate silencing of pfap2-g, thereby up-regulating its transcription and increasing the frequency of sexual differentiation. Our findings reveal a key connection between metabolite utilization and gene expression in malaria parasites that forms the mechanistic link between phosphatidyl-choline metabolism and the frequency of sexual commitment.",We performed Cut&RUN for H3K9me3 and H3K4me3 on P. falciparum nuclei under different growth media conditions,Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing,Plasmodium falciparum
